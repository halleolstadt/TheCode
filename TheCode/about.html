    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        At Camp Fido, our story began with a simple belief; dogs deserve more than just care-- they deserve joy, companionship, and a second home where they can thrive. Founded by passionate dog lovers, Camp Fido was created to provide a safe and engaging space for pups to play, learn, and grow. What started as a small dream has blossomed into a vibrant community of happy tails and smiling faces. Every wag, bark, and snuggle inspires us to keep raising the bar in doggy daycare. At Camp Fido, your furry family member isn't just a guest-- they're part of our story, and we're honored to be part of theirs.
